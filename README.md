#  </> Algorithms and Data Structures

### Python implementation of common algorithms and data structures.

This repository is a collection of fundamental algorithms and data structures implemented in Python. It was built as a learning resource, a quick reference, and a place to practice core computer science concepts.

## 🏗️ Data Structures Implemented

This section lists the data structures currently available in the repository.

| Structure | Description | Time Complexity (Search/Insert/Delete) | File Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |


## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

This section details the various algorithmic categories and examples available.

### Sorting Algorithms
| Algorithm | Description | Time complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Binary Search](binary_search.py) | Given a sorted array and a target value, if the target is in the array, returns the index of the target. Otherwise, returns None | *O(log n)* |
